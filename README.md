# WorkTreesNuts README

This plugin was written for sole purpose of working on a specific active branch while having cloned a bare git repository.

## Features

After you clone the git repository in a `bare` style and choose (or create) the branch you would like to work on, you can activate the branch through selecting it using "WorkTreesNuts: Select Git Worktree" (ctlr+cmd+r) which will allow you browsing you active git worktree files through command "WorkTreesNuts: Go to File in Active Worktree" (ctlr+cmd+p).

## Known Issues

Currently there's no implementation for a pending changes on source control tab based on active worktree.
